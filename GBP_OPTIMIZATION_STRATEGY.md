# Google Business Profile Optimization Strategy for B2B International Services

**Company**: Devaland Marketing S.R.L.  
**Created**: December 11, 2025  
**Target Markets**: Tier 1 English-speaking countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia) + Select EU countries  
**Business Model**: B2B remote services (no local foot traffic)

---

## Executive Summary

**Current Performance** (November 2025):

- Profile Views: 72 (-19% from October)
- Website Visits: 4 (+300% from October)
- Calls: 0
- Chat Clicks: 0
- Total Interactions: 4

**Challenge**: Traditional GBP strategies focus on local customers. Devaland serves international B2B clients remotely, requiring a different optimization approach.

**Strategy**: Use GBP as a **trust signal** and **credibility anchor** rather than a local discovery tool. Optimize for:

1. Legitimacy verification for international prospects
2. Brand authority and professionalism
3. SEO domain authority boost
4. Review aggregation for social proof

---

## Why GBP Matters for International B2B Companies

### 1. **Trust & Legitimacy Signal**

- B2B buyers research vendors thoroughly before engagement
- GBP with reviews = established, legitimate business
- Physical address (even if not serving locally) = real company, not scam
- 87% of B2B buyers check Google reviews before purchase decisions

### 2. **SEO Authority Boost**

- GBP is a Google-owned property with high domain authority
- Backlink from GBP to devaland.com improves SEO
- Local Business structured data enhances brand SERP
- Knowledge panel potential for branded searches

### 3. **International Credibility**

- USA/UK clients often verify European partners via Google
- Complete GBP = professional, established company
- Empty/incomplete GBP = red flag for international clients

### 4. **Review Consolidation Platform**

- Centralized location for client testimonials
- Google Reviews appear in search results (high visibility)
- Better than scattered Trustpilot/Clutch reviews

---

## Current GBP Analysis

### ✅ Strengths

- Profile exists and is claimed
- Basic information present
- Located in EU (Romania) - legitimate business address

### ⚠️ Weaknesses

- Low visibility (72 views/month)
- Zero calls/chats (but expected for B2B remote services)
- Likely incomplete profile sections
- No reviews or minimal reviews
- No posts/updates
- Missing photos/media

### 🎯 Opportunity

- Transform GBP from local discovery tool → international credibility asset
- Leverage for SEO and brand authority
- Use as social proof aggregation platform

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This:

1. **Keyword Stuffing**:

   - Bad: "Devaland Klaviyo Expert Klaviyo Agency Klaviyo Automation Klaviyo Email"
   - Good: "Devaland - Klaviyo Email Marketing & Automation Agency"

2. **Service Area Confusion**:

   - Don't set local radius (irrelevant for international B2B)
   - Don't select "I serve customers at their location" (causes confusion)

3. **Ignoring Reviews**:

   - Respond to ALL reviews within 24-48 hours
   - Never delete or hide negative reviews (respond professionally)

4. **Inconsistent NAP** (Name, Address, Phone):

   - Ensure exact match across: GBP, website footer, about page, contact page
   - Inconsistency hurts SEO and trust

5. **Neglecting Posts**:

   - Don't let GBP go stale
   - Post at least 2x per month minimum

6. **Poor Quality Photos**:

   - No blurry, pixelated, or unprofessional images
   - All photos should be branded and high-resolution

7. **Fake Reviews**:
   - Never buy reviews or ask friends/employees to review
   - Google detects and penalizes this severely

## FAQs for International B2B Companies

**Q: Does GBP help if I don't serve local customers?**

A: Yes! GBP serves different purposes for international B2B:

- Trust signal for international prospects researching you
- SEO boost (backlink from high-authority Google property)
- Review aggregation platform
- Brand legitimacy indicator
- Appears in branded search results

**Q: Should I hide my Romanian address?**

A: No! Having a physical address is a positive trust signal. International clients expect European agencies to have EU addresses. Hiding it looks suspicious. Instead, clearly state "Remote services for USA, UK, CA, AU, EU clients" in your description.

**Q: Why are my profile views so low?**

A: For international B2B, GBP isn't a primary discovery channel. Views come from:

- Clients researching you after finding website
- People verifying your legitimacy
- Branded searches (your company name)
- Focus on quality over quantity - 72 views from qualified prospects > 500 views from local residents

**Q: Should I respond to Romanian-language inquiries?**

A: Yes, but quickly direct to target market:

- Respond politely in Romanian
- Explain you specialize in international e-commerce
- Refer local inquiries to local agencies (goodwill gesture)
- Most inquiries should come through website anyway

**Q: Can I run ads to my GBP?**

A: Not recommended for international B2B. Better to:

- Run Google Ads to website landing pages
- Use LinkedIn Ads for B2B targeting
- Invest in SEO for organic visibility
- GBP is credibility tool, not acquisition channel

---
