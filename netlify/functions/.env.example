# Netlify Functions Environment Variables
# These must be set in Netlify UI: Site settings > Environment variables
# NOT in a .env file (Netlify functions don't read .env files from the repo)

# ============================================
# SMTP Email Configuration (Required)
# ============================================
# Set these exact variable names in Netlify UI

# Option A: Gmail (Recommended for testing)
# 1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
# 2. Generate an App Password at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 3. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
# 4. Copy the 16-character password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password

# Option B: SendGrid (Recommended for production)
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_USER=apikey
# SMTP_PASSWORD=your-sendgrid-api-key

# Option C: AWS SES (Enterprise production)
# SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_USER=your-aws-smtp-username
# SMTP_PASSWORD=your-aws-smtp-password

# Recipient email for contact form notifications
CONTACT_EMAIL=office@devaland.com

# ============================================
# How to Set in Netlify
# ============================================
# 1. Go to Netlify Dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
# 2. Select your site
# 3. Go to: Site settings > Environment variables
# 4. Click "Add a variable" for each of the above
# 5. Set the same values for both "Production" and "Deploy previews"
# 6. Redeploy your site after adding variables

# ============================================
# Important Notes
# ============================================
# - NEVER commit actual passwords to git
# - Use different SMTP credentials for production vs preview deploys for security
# - Test email delivery after setting environment variables
# - Check function logs in Netlify UI if emails aren't sending
